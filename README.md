# Frameworks

This project was created with "create-react-app" & a static JSON API was used for fetching
API:"https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/LZRVL"

## Improvements with More Time
- I would create my own backend server & also a data base to store the doctor's & user's info.
- I would work on the interactions & design of the overall project.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
- Getting a 3rd party API was very difficult so i created a static JSON & used it.
- While bulding the schedule card, i realized that the API isn't upto the mark so i have to update it multiple times in order to get things right.
- I only stored id in react-context later i realised i need to store the date & time so i fixed it & it looked good at the end.
